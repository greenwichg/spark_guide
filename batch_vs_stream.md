## Batch and Stream Processing

**We wait for the collected data to reach a certain threshold (e.g., daily, weekly,…), then process them all at once. This is called batch processing.**

**That might be too long. Instead of waiting, we can process a piece of data right after it happens. After completing this piece, the next one will follow, and things will continue to unfold in this manner. This is called stream processing.**
